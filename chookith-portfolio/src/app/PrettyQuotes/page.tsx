                <br />
                its cruel to give us so many languages to say i love you in,
                with only enough time to learn a few.
                <br />

                for a god not bound to tell the truth, youre the one seeking it
                <br />
                theres always a weak spot in the boundary. a gate. a broken
                panel. love.
                <br />
                where do you draw the line between dreams and nightmares? when
                does heads become tails?
                <br />
                remind me of what it was to travel. unbound. unrestrained.
                unhindered by the weight of the rest of your domain.
                <br />
                remind me what it was to be young. bound only by dawn and dusk.
                restrained only by your imagination. hindered only by height.
                <br />
                remind me of what it was to have. freedom. youth. dreams
