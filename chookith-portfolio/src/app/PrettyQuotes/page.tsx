              Act i. Womenhood
              <br />
              In the wings of a theatre you could be anything. a demand for
              silence. a disemobody voice. the unfathemable beginning
              <br />
              The stagelights however demand the definition of the self.
              <br />
              <i>
                Why do you dress like that? what's with the makeup? why do you
                act like that? why...
              </i>
              <br />
              When you demand silence in the stage lights, you are seen as
              something rather than someone. A broken character. A reason not to
              be believed
              <br />
              <i>
                You know some of the most silent characters will be better then
                those who speak.
              </i>
              <br />
              But what is the point of the voice if not to be heard. If not to
              scream
            </p>
            <p>
              <br />
              act ii. man hood
              <br />
              when the feminine mask melted away in the tears. your screams were
              finally heard and feared
              <br />
              when drowning these memories of a past life, the burn in the back
              of your throat began to taste like symphonies of lyres and choirs.
              the choir asking for more. but more of what?
              <i>
                <br />
                lust?
                <br />
                alcohol?
                <br />
                violence?
                <br />
              </i>
              would you believe me if I told you I lost it. Would you still love
              me if I did listen to the choir?
            </p>
            <p>

              act iii. god hood
              <br />
              enter <i>Dionysus</i>
              <br />
              [Dionysus]:
              <br />
              do you believe in me yet? no? even after you tasted my wine soaked
              lips or what about when i drenched myself in your blood
              <br />
              next time i die i'll come ask you.
              <br /> but in the meantime the flower garlands and ivy seem
              brighter. the grapes sweeter. and my festivals marrier.
