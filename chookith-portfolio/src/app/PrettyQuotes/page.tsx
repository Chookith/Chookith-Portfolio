                <b>i.</b> If your shoulder blades were to bend themselves back
                into wings, your kneecaps would swallow themselves like
                cavanagh; the shiver in your throat would earthquake into melted
                choclate and sunshine. The lampshade would nebula into burning
                bush and old oak tombstones
                <br />
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>ii.</b> you say gabriel visits you in your sleep, tell you
                with deft enochian and bare teeth that{" "}
                <i>
                  you are comprised of spider silk and the favorite color of my
                  father
                </i>
                before speaking about the end of the world, the ichor in your
                palms. Red hyacinth dust drifts off his eyelashes, and apathy
                falls off his tongue like boiling blood
                <br />
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>iii.</b> For the next month, there are bruises on your elbows
                and the remenants of a dead language rattling in your lungs. You
                wake up in the river, thighs carved with sigils and crows
                perching on your shoulders, weeping ichor and ancient clay. the
                names of your newfound kin ring in your ears until your partner
                confesses that you scream them in your sleep.
                <br />

                <b>iv.</b> gabriel visits again, six months after you realize
                that your native language has slipped from your tongue and
                realize that seclusion is more of a gift than another cross for
                you to bear. afterwards, you tell me that he had four sets of
                wings, three eyes and seventeen hearts, and the most unusual
                feature was the trembling in his steps, his inability to remain
                still as he phased in and out of this world into another.

                <b>v.</b> you say his reverence was a holy march, a fragment of

                scorching the skin of my heart,

                <br /> that his hands are gentle,
                <br /> that his fingerprints wont't be seared into the notches
                of my spine.

                The sun inside of him could set the kingdom ablaze; he knows

                to face the flame.
